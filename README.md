# TheOracle

A bot written with [Discord.Net](https://discord.foxbot.me/stable/) for [Ironsworn](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/) and its derived games, with a focus on play-by-post games.

## Features

### Oracle Tables
TheOracle includes oracles tables for Ironsworn, and can easily be extended to include additional tables. It even supports rolling multiple tables at once, and oracles that roll other oracle tables.

### Rules Reference
You don't have to lookup rules in the quick reference PDF any more, just ask the bot and it will post the rules text for you.

### Progress Tracker
TheOracle can track the progress for just about anything you want. Track short term game goals like journeys, or long term goals like epic character vows.

### Game Element Generators
Quickly and easily add things like settlements, and NPCs to your game. TheOracle uses interactive posts to help you create a rich world quickly.

### Initiative Tracker
Easily keep track of who has initiative, and who is in trouble.

### Localization Support (Full support scheduled for v1.0.0)
TheOracle is written in a way that makes it easier to localize into your native language. Just fork the project, edit the resource files, and add a pull request and you localization will be added.

## Commands
Most commands and oracle tables names have shorter hand versions of them, but command clarity is one of the goals of this bot so overly cryptic and short commands are avoided. If a command needs more information such as a progress tracker difficulty a helper post will give you options to select from.

* *Command Aliases:* None

## Generic Message Reactions
Apply one of these reactions to any of the bot's posts to help you manage your game and keep your channel up to date and free of clutter.

#### Move Existing Post To Bottom of Chat
Simply react to any bot post with the ‚è¨ `:arrow_double_down:` reaction to move it to the bottom of your chat. This is useful for moving things like progress trackers and NPCs, as an alternative to needing separate channels, or multiple pinned messages.

#### Delete a Post
React with :x: `:x:` then the bot will add a :ballot_box_with_check: `:ballot_box_with_check:` reaction for you to confirm the delete. This is helpful to remove things like initiative trackers or progress trackers for little things from the chat.

#### Pin a Post
React to a bot message with :pushpin: `:pushpin:` and the bot will pin the message for you. Make sure to leave the reaction on the message until you are ready to unpin it.
